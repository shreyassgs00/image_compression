A simple representation of the Huffman encoding algorithm in Python.

Given an image, the program generates the final compression ratio of the encoded image versus the actual image.

To run the program with a different image, simply download an image of choice in the 'image' folder and change the path of the image in the open image function in main.py, line 11 and execute the file using 'python3 main.py' for Linux based distributions or 'py -3 main.py' for Windows.
The program prints the final compression ratio.
